- Though the overall- average complexity of the code was : A 
However the Complexity of the daysInY1 was B, and was reduced to A in this assignment : 

daysInY1() function was divided into modules : The number of days after M1- found using finDaysAfterM1- line 29 to 39 of Assignment-3c
Note : No new code was written, only daysInY1() function was divided - line 39 to 46 of Assignment-3b

NOTE: The Final Complexity Grade q2.py- Assignment-3c
