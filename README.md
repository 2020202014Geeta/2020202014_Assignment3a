- To improve the average complexity:
   - makeParentList() function was divided into modules : fun2()- line 15 to 23 of Assignment-3c
   - No new code was written, only makeParentList() function was divided - line 26 to 31 of Assignment-3b

- The Final Average Complexity Grade q1.py- Assignment-3c

### Que 2:  
- Earlier the complexity of q2.py of Assignment-3b was:

- Though the overall- average complexity of the code was : A, 
   - However the Complexity of the daysInY1 was B, and was reduced to A in this assignment : 
   - daysInY1() function was divided into modules : The number of days after M1- found using finDaysAfterM1- line 29 to 39 of Assignment-3c
   - No new code was written, only daysInY1() function was divided - line 39 to 46 of Assignment-3b

- The Final Complexity Grade q2.py- Assignment-3c

### Que 3:
- No changes were made to the code.
- The Average complexity Grade of q3.py- Assignment-3c : A
